# list type features
# 1. list is mutable
# 2. list is ordered
# 3. list is iterable
# 4. list is indexed
# 5. list is slicing
# 6. list is nesting

# tuple type features
# 1. tuple is immutable  !!!!!
# 2. tuple is ordered
# 3. tuple allows duplicate values
# 4. tuple is iterable
# 5. tuple is indexed
# 6. tuple is slicing
# 7. tuple is nesting

# set type features
# 1. set is mutable
# 2. set is unordered
# 3. set is iterable
# 4. set is unindexed
# 5. set is slicing
# 6. set is nesting
# 7. set does not allow duplicate values


# dict type features
# 1. dict is mutable
# 2. dict is unordered
# 3. dict is iterable
# 4. dict is indexed (based on keys, not indexed by sequence of numbers)
# 5. dict is slicing
# 6. dict is nesting
# 7. dict does not allow duplicate keys
